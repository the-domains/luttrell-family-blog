            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Disney - Day 2</h1><p>Big day today! We made our way to the Magic Kingdom in time to see the parade coming down Main Street with dancers and singers, and even some of the girls' favorite Disney characters like Woody and Jessie.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc8220a829c3e7aa628e1c6fa71796f0c3774ee0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Disney Vacation - Day 1]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Disney Vacation - Day 1</h1><p>Day 1 was a successful day! We started at the airport for the girls' first plane ride. Both of them did really well for nearly the entire ride, except for Norah complaining about her ears hurting a little bit near the end. They both sat with daddy and played with their new princess & Frozen magnetic dress up boards, and a few games on the Leapster and iPad. They were also super excited to be served pretzels and their choice of drink - OJ for Naomi and apple juice for Norah.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b948cd82e9e1396c37394bbd495625b2e87f487.jpg"></article>]]></description>
