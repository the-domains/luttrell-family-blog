Big day today! We made our way to the Magic Kingdom in time to see the parade coming down Main Street with dancers and singers, and even some of the girls' favorite Disney characters like Woody and Jessie.

Next we caught a quick glimpse of the castle, then headed over to some rides in Tomorrowland. First we did the Laugh Factory. Somehow, Jason ended up on the big video screen with a caption of "Has an uncontrollable desire to dance" and proceeded to do his best dancing. The girls were all very proud.  :)

After we tried out a Stitch ride that we ended up leaving quickly as it was very dark and scary, which the girls reminded us about all day about being horrible. Oops.

Later in the day, we did Small World, Peter Pan, Tea Cups (Norah fell down in the tea cup and hit her eye), Magic Carpet, Dumbo, and the Carousel. The girls also got to meet Repunzel and Cinderella - they didn't seem to be super excited, but mostly shy (and tired). We wrapped up the day at the park with a ride on a roller coaster that they both really liked.

To top off the day, the girls swam at night in the cold pool for a bit before bedtime. Tomorrow we're headed to Epcot and we'll get to meet up with the Hall family!
