Day 1 was a successful day! We started at the airport for the girls' first plane ride. Both of them did really well for nearly the entire ride, except for Norah complaining about her ears hurting a little bit near the end. They both sat with daddy and played with their new princess & Frozen magnetic dress up boards, and a few games on the Leapster and iPad. They were also super excited to be served pretzels and their choice of drink - OJ for Naomi and apple juice for Norah.

As we got off the plane and walked through the airport, their excitement grew as we saw several Disney displays, including ones of Mickey and Goofy!

We boarded the Disney Magic Express bus and headed to our resort, the Art of Animation. Unfortunately, we were too late to make a special character dinner we had reserved - hopefully we can make that up later in the week. Instead, we checked out the fun resort decorations, our room, and the two pools! Finally, we went to dinner. Everyone enjoyed the food, although Norah barely ate anything and complained about her ear hurting. Then, about 15 minutes later in our room, she threw up. She's a trooper though - after that she was great the rest of the night. Looking forward to Day 2!
